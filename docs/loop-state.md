# Loop state

## Current execution

Production serves `ef81b8917209f4eec3f22097142b559f3cce875b` / `pmi-kc-app-rmw65wgt2-8c8249a0547c` at 100% canonical traffic.
PR #191 and source PRs #184–#190 shipped together in run `72c6456a-3f3f-4ec2-8282-03542cfb7772` after all seven
exact-main CI jobs passed in `42356598810`. The controller exited zero and its permit is consumed.
Observation passed 2 checkpoints in 410,069 ms with 375 matched
source, projected and rendered lease records, zero discrepancies, candidate 5xx, unresolved effects
or guarded mutation attempts. The eleven independent final readbacks passed at
`2026-11-07T09:12:03Z`. See the [delivery evidence](evidence/renewal-one-path-delivery-2026-11-07.md).

The [independent litmus](evidence/renewal-one-path-litmus-2026-11-06.md) retains 62 Yes, two No and seven
UNVERIFIED on its complete `edba7cbb` run, with separately dated repair rechecks. L55 remains No
because the settled assistance rule classifies the voucher-only lease as Ready. Batch acceptance
remains No. Human verdict NOT RUN.

The earlier [S245 delivery](evidence/s245-litmus-fixes-delivery-2026-11-05.md) and
[November 3 configuration outcomes](evidence/application-gap-delivery-2026-11-03.md) retain
their own evidence. The current release changes no workflow authority or held client input.

## Exact remaining boundaries

- **B-GCP-REINDEX:** the app lacks storage.objects.list on its existing corpus bucket. Bucket,
  project/organization policies, five runtime roles and managed-folder absence were inspected;
  owner credentials read one existing Approved/Low source. Its owner-side source-bound command
  passed the actual builder/parser/request/generation checks without import or staging.
  S240 explicitly excludes IAM changes. A private one-permission role/exact-bucket proposal with
  backup/etag-CAS/readback/rollback is ready; only the project owner's narrow scope-deviation
  decision can authorize it. No new permission, login, API, identity or source was needed/created
  to diagnose it. The live SDK exception is not exposed; missing effective permission is
  independently sufficient to prevent that read. Keep the app's honest non-runnable state.
- **B-PROCESS-OWNER:** the published guidance preserves original placeholder owner/default
  approver values. Future run ownership currently derives from default_approver_uid. Dan/team
  must identify the responsible managed staff; the team maps existing UIDs without guessing or
  reinstating a general Dan approval. This holds staff routing, not current publication.
- Canonical U1–U6 in docs/open-blockers.md own real form/legal/map, case/terms, timing exceptions,
  human acceptance/signing, later exact-key authority and the two specific decisions above.
  All eight originals are recovered/private; do not request those files, membership or login again.

## Awaiting release

The queue is empty. Run `72c6456a` delivered S246–S254 in one candidate.
Documentation closure does not require an application revision.

## Continuation contract

1. Use the existing private copy-only client-update workflow/receipt for ordinary communication
   closure from actual current main; never a mailbox draft/send or external message tool.
2. If the project owner explicitly extends S240 for the prepared metadata-only permission,
   re-read its exact private proposal and fresh policy/etag, preserve every unrelated grant,
   use the same existing runtime identity, apply only the approved role/bucket binding and read
   everything back. Verify the unchanged app GET yields the actual source-bound runnable handoff.
   No ingestion or application release is authorized by that decision alone.
3. Dan/team answers become exact version-bound configuration through existing controls. Do not
   invent owner/approver UIDs, legal meanings, fees, source approvals or a universal Dan gate.
4. Both Dotloop write keys remain closed; signing stays human. Existing source/recipient/sender/
   policy/claim/receipt/ambiguity gates continue. No live proof or production test record is rerun.

Approved WSL auth entry remains bash /home/josiah/pmi-kc-work/auth-command-20261102/scripts/pmi-auth.
Reuse existing stores/profile; only an actual Google challenge needs a human. Physical-phone,
Editor-browser/human acceptance, paid comps/generation, indefinite auth and real provider/customer
completion remain unverified in their named scopes.
